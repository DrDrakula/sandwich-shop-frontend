## Sandwich Shop
Video Game with the goal of earning money by making and selling sandwiches. It was built with JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Ruby on Rails. [YouTube Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1NUTggPFDo).

## Motivation Behind the App
The app was made to provide people with some entertainment while on long rides, waiting in line, or when stuck in a subway... :)

## Setup
To setup the game you need to clone both the frontend and the backend repo, and run the backend Rails server. After that you open the index.html file inside of the and click away.
